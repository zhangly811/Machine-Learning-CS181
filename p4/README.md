## Practical 4: Reinforcement Learning

This practical focuses on using reinforcement learning method to develop an agent to play the game Swingy Monkey, a game similar to Flappy Bird. The agent can make the monkey jump to a new vine, or swing down the current vine he is holding, in order to pass the tree trunks coming from both the top and the bottom of the screen. Positive re- ward is given when the monkey successfully passes tree trunks without hitting them, and different negative rewards are given when the monkey falls off the bottom of the screen, jumps off the top, or hit a tree trunk. A better agent is defined as an agent that can achieve higher average score and max score within a certain number of game iterations. Our goal is to train a good agent through various reinforcement learning method (SARSA and Q- learning), and compare their performance with different policy and hyper-parameters on discretized space.
